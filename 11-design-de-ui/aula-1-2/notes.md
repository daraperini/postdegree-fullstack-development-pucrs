# Design de UI

## Prototyping – From Sketching to Simulation

- `Prototype`: simulation of a finished product. Communicate the experience in UX.
  - Requires:
    - Interection
    - Imitation of all real-world processes
    - Single interection or an entire app experience

- `Testing`: the reason to prototype. We should test:
  - Usability
  - Feasibility – can we actually do this
  - Viability – how to support AND improve this

- Testing ideas with real users to get to know what should be improved
  - Is what they expect what they’re getting?
  - What’s easy to use and understand
  - Where and how the users get stuck

`Create -> test -> learn -> revise -> repeat`

- Start small with key things. As we iterate and test the prototype grows
- 20% of the functionality of the app will be used 80% of the time -> that’s what needs to be right to launch the product
- Prototype an user journey, not only a screen

- `Prototype`: interactive simulation
- `Wireframes, Mockups and sketches`: static components

- Early, rapid, continuous prototyping 
`Iterate -> test -> learn -> improve -> repeat`

- Start prototyping the minute a project becomes real
  - Better UX and design choices
  - Keeps focus on Ux and context of use
  - Non-sequention process – doesn’t hold up any other work

- `Mental models`: abstract representations of how things work. How we believe something might or should work.
`Implementation model (reflects technology) -> represented model (what’s designed and built) -> mental model (reflects user’s understading)`
- The closer the represented model is to the mental model the better is the UX.

- `Benefits for using Prototype`:
1. Shared understanding across team, stakeholders and clients
   1. Ilimitations and possibilities are evident to all
   2. Conversation and documentation are wild open to misinterpretation and subjectivity
2. Avoiding critical mobile UX mistakes
   1. There are too many variables in mobile use
3. The earlier you find and fix problems, the easier it is
   1. Re-work complex systems is hard
4. Allows to judge design feasibility
   1. experiment and explore allows us to know if it is going to give us what we want from the product
5. Greatly reduce of surprise requests
   1. managers and stakeholders can see whats is and is not going to be build
6. Closes the gap between design and development
   1. both groups have the same goal
7. Answers 3 critical questions of product design: 
   1. Is this worth doing?
   2. Does everyone agree on and understand what we're creating?
   3. What value does it deliver?

- `Fidelity` to the real product is different depending on what we need to know, test and learn. We have to take in consideration:
  - Goals of prototyping
  - Completeness of desing
    - Does the product already exists?
  - Valiable resources

- `Levels of Fidelity`:
  -  `low-fi`: almost a sketches
     -  Hand sketched
     -  Limitate user interaction
     -  Quickest to create
     -  Rapid iterations, rapid improvement
     -  Ideal for multiple iterative design explorations
     -  Quick way to get feedback from users
     -  Safety for people to suggest changes
     -  Invites collaboration, participation and feedback
  -  `mid-fi`: indicates what is where
     -  More content
     -  UI detail is progressively added
     -  Minimal or "faked" iteractivity
     -  True function fidelity is minimal - linking pages and screens to simulate the user experience
  -  `hi-fi`: pretty much everyting looks how it's gonna look when the product is ready
     -  All user interections are well represented
     -  Exact representation of the UI and it's interactivity
     -  Ideal for collectiong measurable data


### Low Fidelity Prototyping

- `Goal`: check and test usability and functionality
- We're not worried about how it sould look
- We're worried about:
  - how it's gonna work
  - how well it works
  - wheter or not the interections can be undertood and used by people
- Use it early on in a project is wise
  
- `Has to be`:
  - Fast
  - Inexpensive
  - Accurate

- `Rules`:
  - Limited colors (blue for buttons and hyperlinks)
  - No images or graphical data displays
  - No fonts other than Arial
  - Real labels on all interactive components
  - Real text content, to whatever degree possible
  - Keep interactions simple
  - Annotate to begin suggesting and documenting functions and requirements
  - After 48h, start building something
    - First 2 days are for contextual use scenarios: what stakeholders want and where are conflicts. How people use the system now and how we think they will use it.
    - Day 3 are for prototyping informations and interactions: things the user needs to know and needs to be able to do. Prototyping answers questions from prior work: how much content do we need to expose? how many different types/formats of data do we have? How many are static or interactive? how to organize? ... TRY, EVALUATE, REVISE!

- `Characterists`:
  - Bare-minimum visual design
    - It's a skeleton
    - Focus on how the user is going to interact - using even phrases to explain
    - Only use basic elements and shapes
    - Design choices are purely spacial
  - Only include key-content elements
    - Express how much content there might be
    - How it'll be organized, prioritized, labeled across all screens
    - As much real content is needed for users to understand what the project is going to do
  - Interactivity is simulated
    - We can interact but there's no real production code underneath thoes interactions
  - Actions always take prioprity in lo-fi

- `Pros`:
  - inexpensive
  - fast
  - collaborative effort
  - clarifies expectations
- `Cons`:
  - user confusion skews results
  - misplaced user focus (focus on the unfinished design)
  - limited interactivity
  - limited contributions of developers (its not real enough)
  - low visual impact

- Lo-fi is the right place to start

### High-fidelity Prototyping

- `Goal`: simulate and test the real thing
- How it's inteded to work ahd how it should respond to user interactions
- The final quality inspection
- That's were any large error has to be seen and corrected before the build
- All interactive elements have to be there
  
- When do we move to Hi-fi?
  - When basic functionality is stablished, tested and done
  - When you need to fully design and test advanced interactions
  - When collaborating on complex functionality with developers

- `Characterists`:
  - Realistic visual hierarchy, priority of screen elements and screen size
    - everything looks just like the real thing
  - Real content
    - has to include all the contet that would appear in the final design
    - numbers: doens't have to be accurate but the number of character each contains, symbols, decimal points, alignment, need to be simulated to mimic the real thing
  - Responsive to user actions
    - intereactions, transitions, error messages...

- `Benefits`:
  - They help you think through design
  - Error are relatively easy to correct
  - Ideas become visible language
  - Communicate ideas between team members
  - They clearly communicate proposed functionality exposing potential development issues

- `Pros`:
  - much more realistic and faster system response
  - more aspects of the experience can be tested
  - users behave more accurate - makes testing more accurate
  - keeps focus on user behavior instead of the prototype
  - less likely to be affected by human error
  - improved collaboration with developers
  - shared understading with product owners, stakeholders and clients
  - save time and money

- `cons`:
  - not as fast or cheap
  - take longer to update
  - users may not be as honest with criticism
  - users may fixate on the wrong things
  - effort spent so far discourages designers to make changes

### Prototyping Journey

- `How to go from Lo-fi to hi-fi`:

- 3 techniques or formats:
  1. rapid, sketched paper or whiteboard based prototypes
  2. lo-fi, monochrimatic wireframe prototypes
  3. hi-fi interactive prototypes that mimic the real thing

- Iterations:
  1. iteration 1: `lo-fi prototype -> user testing -> repeat`
  2. iteration 2: `mid-fi prototype -> user testing -> repeat`
  3. iteration 3: `hi-fi prototype -> user testing -> repeat`

- The process has to be addapted depending on what we need out of it.

#### Paper and Whiteboard Prototyping

- Handraw
- Exploring different ideas, testing different designs
- Ux designs + developers

- Start with flows
  - how user would accomplish a task
  - keep it simple
  - tell the story, step by step
  - allow that story to be messy and real 
  - involve users and customers
    - from there we can start developing screens
- Whiteboard prototyping:
  - drawing screens
  - interface, notes, what to deal later
- Paper works:
  - use paper and manipulate it 
  - draw screens in paper and switches it during users' decisions

- `Benefits`:
  - leverage evetyone's collective brainpower
    - everyone can sketch and build paper prototypes
  - testing happens almost immediately
  - rapid, increased experimentation
    - multiple ideas is the ideal
  - prototypes serve a documentation
  - makes adjustments quick and painless

- `Limites`:
  - with papel you'll need at least two people to conduct an usability test
    - 1 facilitator and 1 user
  - difficult to represent omplex operations

#### Wireframes

- Lo-fi monochromatic wireframes
- Made in the pc
- Visual representation of a screen a designer uses to arrange page elements
- A foundation for lo-fi prototypes
- Don't look like the finished product
- Don't require a facilitator
- Represent information priority and organization on screen of elements, labeling and categorization, organization, how to interect...
- Is not aan actual UI design -> only show how it's gonna work, not how it's gonna look
- Prototype for design and development -> structure, content, information hierarchy, functionality, behavior

1. Start with sketches
2. Use real layouts specs
   1. decide a grid
   2. real content if possible
   3. design the structure, not the look
3. use real labels and text
4. go past the happy path
   1. prototype errors

#### Hi-fi Interactive Prototypes

- Best possible imitations of an actual product
- Test, validate, approve
  
- `Characterists`:
  - realistic visual UI design
  - real or simulated interactivity

- Accurate, meaningful feedback during testing
- More elements and sequences can be tested
- Less debating or argument from clients and stakeholders
- Clear understandment of what it is

- Take longer to create

#### Coded Prototypes

- `Coded prototyping`:
  - dev teams create "sandboxes": an area for people to play with things, an isolated virtual environment where the coded prototype lives
  - reveals limits and constrains of the technology and the environment
  - it's efficient
  - not always advisable to create reusable code: create one-time, throw it away code so you have it faster to present
  - for lo, mid or hi-fi

- `Advantages`:
  - encourages design in context
    - tells if it's possible and how it works
  - code works across all devices and platforms
  - low cost
  - it can serve as a foundation for the final product

- `Disadvantages`:
  - requires familiarity with coding
  - not easy to revise
  - code isn't always reusable

#### Prototyping Process

- `Create, test, revise`

- `Iterations`:
  1. Iterate content structure and information architecture
    1. lo-fi
    2. organize, categorize, prioritize, relate and sequence of content
  2. Iterate use scenarions and workflows
    1. focus on how users are going to move through that content and data
  3. Iterate UI, interaction testing and improvement
    1. UI element that are necessary for users to interect
    2. Increase fidality gradualy
    3. Testing:
       1. can be informal
       2. with anyone how's capable of putting themselves in the user's position

- Iterate: exploring, trying things. It can chance based on what you've learned in the next round of iteration
